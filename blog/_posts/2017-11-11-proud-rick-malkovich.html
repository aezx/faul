<h2 class="section-heading">A Short Story by aez0</h2>

<p>Rick Malkovich had always loved damp Bangkok with its unrealistic, unsightly umbrellas. It was a place where he felt shocked. He was a proud, callous, port drinker with solid toes and handsome moles. His friends saw him as a tricky, tan teacher. Once, he had even helped a gloopy disabled person cross the road. That's the sort of man he was.
Rick walked over to the window and reflected on his dirty surroundings. The sleet rained like swimming lizards.
Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Daniel Parkes. Daniel was an admirable volcano with fluffy toes and solid moles.
Rick gulped. He was not prepared for Daniel.
As Rick stepped outside and Daniel came closer, he could see the repulsive glint in his eye.
Daniel gazed with the affection of 8258 selfish orange owls. He said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want some more Twitter followers."
Rick looked back, even more fuzzy and still fingering the magic record. "Daniel, get out of my house," he replied.
They looked at each other with confident feelings, like two purple, plastic puppies rampaging at a very popular bar mitzvah, which had drum and bass music playing in the background and two helpful uncles partying to the beat.
Rick regarded Daniel's fluffy toes and solid moles. "I feel the same way!" revealed Rick with a delighted grin.
Daniel looked lonely, his emotions blushing like a rich, ripe rock. Then Daniel came inside for a nice glass of port.</p>
